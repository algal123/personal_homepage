I am a postdoctoral researcher in mathematics at the **Bundeswehr University Munich**, working in algebraic number theory, Iwasawa theory, special values of $L$-functions, and cohomological constructions such as Eisenstein cocycles and Stickelberger elements.

More broadly, I am interested in the interplay between cohomology, arithmetic geometry, and special values of $L$-functions, as well as in adelic and $p$-adic methods that refine classical number-theoretic constructions.

On this website you can find information about my **research**, **publications**, and **teaching**. Over time, I also plan to add notes, slides, and other material related to my talks and courses.
